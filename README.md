This repo contains the notebooks for deep learning AI crash course on Tensorflow.

## Course 1 Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
1. House price with linear model - single neuron. 
2. Hand writing recognition with fully connected layers.
3. Improve MNIST with convolutions.
4. Image classifier for complex images.Create a classifier for a set of happy or sad images with callback to cancel training once accuracy is greater than 0.99.

### Learning
* input_shape definition
* layer object: method and attribute
* Kernel and bias: kernel can be thought as weights
* Implement helper function to calculate the number of parameter for various layers
* Implement training as function



## Course 2 Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow


## Course 3 Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow


## Course 4 Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
